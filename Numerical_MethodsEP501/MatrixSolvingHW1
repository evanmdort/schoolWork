five problems focusing on 
1. forward elimination and substitution using gaussian elimination
2. elimination for computing matrix inverses
3. LU factorization for solving linear systems
4. Iterative method of solving linear system using successive over realxation
5. Using gaussian elimination to also compute the determinant
