Projects for my numerical methods course covering numerical techniques for solving a variety of engineering problems.
Some of the included functions were provided by the professor in order to allow us to focus on a specific 
equation. One example being that he provided a 2D newton method that we were then required to extrapolate out to
3 dimensions. His repository for the course with the code he provided to us can be found at https://github.com/mattzett/EP501
